* cl-sdl2-hershey

This repository adds the capability to use Hershey vector fonts with cl-sdl2.

* Install

It is highly recommended to use the environment provided by qlot. Execute

#+begin_src shell
ros install qlot # if it is not installed yet
qlot install
#+end_src

The library is neither on ultralisp nor quicklisp, so you will need to checkout the repository.

* Usage

The API is still subject to change. Currently minimalistic string printing without safety net is supported. See the example for code.

* Example

[[./fonts.png]]

#+begin_src lisp
(ql:quickload :cl-sdl2-hershey/example)
(cl-sdl2-hershey/example:main)
#+end_src

The example currently executes fine within emacs, but not from the command line. That is probably due to thread issues and my Mac M1.

* Origin

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hershey_fonts][Hershey Fonts]]

I think it is appropriate that one of the oldest programming languages should make use one of the oldest public vector fonts.

A description of the data format can be found [[https://paulbourke.net/dataformats/hershey/][here]].
